A smoky rub and a sticky, spicy glaze give double the flavour.

I like to brine my wings as it plumps up the chicken, but this is optional. You’d need to brine the wings at least 4 hours before cooking.",Serves 4,90,"8–12 chicken wings || 2 bunches spring onions, chopped || sesame seeds, to garnish (optional) || 1 tbsp sea salt || 1 large onion, roughly chopped || 1–2 rosemary sprigs || 2 bay leaves || black peppercorns || 2 tbsp smoked paprika || 2 tbsp garlic powder || 2 tbsp onion powder || 1 tbsp dried chilli flakes, crushed (optional) || 1 tbsp freshly ground black pepper || 1 tbsp light brown sugar || 4 tbsp vegetable oil || 1–3 Scotch bonnet chillies, finely chopped (optional) || 3 tbsp soy sauce || 3 tbsp vegetable stock or water || 3 tbsp honey || 2 tbsp brown sugar || 3 tbsp cider vinegar or rice vinegar || 3 tbsp tomato ketchup || 1 large onion, finely chopped || 1 tbsp grated fresh ginger || 2 tbsp finely chopped garlic || 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper || 1 bay leaf","Rinse the chicken wings and pat dry then burn the hairs off the wing tips – over a gas hob or using a blowtorch. || If you want to brine the wings, put the salt, onion, rosemary, bay leaves and peppercorns in a big pot, add about 1 litre/1¾ pints cold water and stir to dissolve the salt.

Drain the wings and pat dry, discarding the brine. || Prepare your barbecue: allow the flames to die down until the coals are just glowing. || Meanwhile, for the spice rub, mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl. Add the chicken wings and turn to coat in the spice rub: use a spoon or wear disposable or clean rubber gloves to protect your skin from the Scotch bonnets, if using. Set aside for 10–20 minutes for the flavours to infuse. || To make the glaze, put all the ingredients in a small saucepan and simmer for about 15 minutes until the volume of liquid is reduced by half, stirring occasionally to prevent it from burning. If it separates, add a little cold water to bring it back together. Take care not to overreduce: it should be syrupy and sticky, but not thick. || When the barbecue is ready, put the wings on the barbecue and grill for 30–45 minutes (see the recipe tip, if your barbecue has a lid), turning every 10–15 minutes and brushing the glaze over both sides, until browned and cooked through. To test with a probe thermometer, the internal temperature of the chicken should be above 74C. Alternatively, test by piercing the thickest part with a skewer: the juices should run clear.

Caribbean jerk chicken,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/caribbean_jerk_chicken_18860,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/collections/caribbean_barbecue_recipes,"Most Caribbean families make their own jerk spice rub, which may be wet or dry. In my family, in the 1970s, our jerk chicken was not always made with young chicken, but cleaning the meat by rubbing it with lemon, then brining, then marinating, then cooking it over a smoky barbecue made it very flavoursome. The chicken you buy these days is usually young and doesn’t need brining, but the brine will plump up the chicken and add flavour.

The main recipe describes how to cook jerk chicken in the oven, but instructions for cooking on a barbecue are in the recipe tips.",Serves 6,180,"1 chicken, jointed (or a pack of mixed chicken pieces) || 1 tbsp olive oil || 2 tbsp barbecue sauce || lime wedges, to serve || 1 tbsp sea salt || 1 large onion, roughly chopped || 1–2 rosemary sprigs || 2 bay leaves || black peppercorns || 2 tbsp ground allspice or all-purpose seasoning || 1 tsp allspice berries || 1 tsp freshly grated nutmeg || 1 tbsp ground cinnamon || 1 tbsp grated fresh ginger || 1 tbsp freshly ground black pepper || 1 tbsp salt || 1 tbsp light brown sugar || 1½ tbsp cider vinegar || 1½ tbsp soy sauce || 1 onion, chopped || 8 garlic cloves, roughly chopped || 2–3 Scotch bonnet chillies, seeds removed (unless you like it hot), roughly chopped || large handful fresh thyme, leaves picked, or 2 tsp dried thyme","If you want to brine the chicken, put the salt, onion, rosemary, bay leaves and peppercorns in a big pot, add about 1 litre/1¾ pints cold water and stir to dissolve the salt. Add the chicken, adding a little more water if necessary to ensure they are completely submerged. Leave in the fridge for at least 4 hours or overnight. Drain the chicken and pat dry, discarding the brine. || Put all the ingredients for the jerk rub into a blender or a pestle and mortar, add about 3 tablespoons water and blitz or pound until smooth. || Put the chicken in a bowl and pour over the jerk rub. Using a spoon (or wearing disposable or clean rubber gloves to protect your skin from the Scotch bonnets), turn the chicken in the mixture. Cover and leave to marinate in the fridge for at least 4 hours or preferably overnight. || Take the chicken out of the fridge 1–2 hours before you want to cook it, to bring it up to room temperature. || Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Put the chicken on a rack over a roasting tin and cook for 30 minutes, turning the chicken after about 15 minutes and basting with the juices from the roasting tin. The chicken is cooked when the skin is an even dark brown colour and the juices run clear when pierced with a skewer in the thickest part. || Turn up the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Pour off the chicken juices from the roasting tin and mix with barbecue sauce.

Apricot almond cake with rosewater and cardamom,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/apricot_almond_cake_with_90181,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/collections/dairy-free_baking,"This is my idea of a perfect cake: simple, beautiful, fragrant and beguiling. I’ve been making this sort of cake, in one form or another, since my clementine cake in How To Eat, and I can’t help but feel, with a certain calm excitement, that it has reached its apogee here. 

For this recipe you will need a 20cm/8in round springform cake tin and a food processor.",Serves 8-10,90,"150g/5½oz ready-to-eat dried apricots || 2 cardamom pods, cracked || 200g/7oz ground almonds || 50g/1¾oz fine polenta (not instant) || 1 tsp baking powder (gluten-free if required) || 150g/5½oz caster sugar || 6 large free-range eggs || 2 tsp lemon juice || 1 tsp rosewater || non-stick cooking spray or sunflower oil for greasing || 2 tsp rose petal or apricot jam || 1 tsp lemon juice || 2½ tsp very finely chopped pistachios","Put the dried apricots into a small saucepan, cover them with 250ml/9fl oz cold water, and drop in the cracked cardamom pods with their fragrant seeds. Put on the heat, then bring to the boil and let it bubble for 10 minutes – don’t stray too far away from the pan, as by the end of the 10 minutes the pan will be just about out of water and you want to make sure it doesn’t actually run dry as the apricots will absorb more water as they cool. Take the pan off the heat, place on a cold, heatproof surface and let the apricots cool. || Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease the sides of the springform cake tin and line the bottom with baking parchment. || Remove 5 of the dried apricots and tear each in half, then set aside. Discard the cardamom husks, leaving the seeds in the pan. || Pour and scrape out the sticky contents of the pan into the bowl of a food processor. Add the ground almonds, polenta, baking powder, caster sugar and eggs, and give a good long blitz to combine. || Open the top of the processor, scrape down the batter, add 2 teaspoons of lemon juice and the rosewater, and blitz again. Scrape into the prepared tin and smooth with a spatula. Arrange the apricot halves around the circumference of the tin. || Bake for 40 minutes, though if the cake is browning up a lot before it’s actually ready, you may want to cover loosely with foil at the 30-minute mark. When it’s ready, the cake will be coming away from the edges of the tin, the top will feel firm, and a cake tester will come out with just one or two damp crumbs on it. || Remove the cake to a wire rack. If you’re using apricot jam to decorate, you may want to warm it a little first so that it’s easier to spread; rose petal jam is so lusciously soft-set, it shouldn’t need any help. Stir a teaspoon of lemon juice into the jam and brush over the top of the cake, then sprinkle with the chopped pistachios and leave the cake to cool in its tin before removing to a plate.",best cake | easter cake | baking with spice | nutty cakes | dairy-free cake | eid sweets | gluten-free cake | gluten-free christmas desserts and baking | gluten-free dessert recipes | how to make cakes | nigella's christmas | perfect pistachio | spiced cakes | valentine's day baking | birthday party | hanukkah | mother's day | spring recipes | almond cake | dried apricots | ground almonds | dairy free | gluten free | pregnancy friendly | vegetarian | Simply Nigella | Cakes and baking | Turkish and Middle Eastern | http://schema.org/LowLactoseDiet | http://schema.org/GlutenFreeDiet | http://schema.org/VegetarianDiet,4.548387096774194,31

Chocolate mousse,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/basicchocolatemousse_93648,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/collections/dark_chocolate_treats,Raymond Blanc shows you how to make chocolate mousse in this classic recipe that only uses 4 ingredients and can be made up to a day ahead. Perfect for a dinner party or special occasion.,Serves 4,130,"170g/6oz good-quality dark chocolate, minimum 60 per cent cocoa solids, roughly chopped (dairy free, if necessary) || 7 free-range egg whites (use pasteurised egg white from a carton if you have concerns about raw eggs) || ¼ tsp lemon juice || 40g/1½oz caster sugar","Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water (do not allow the base of the bowl to touch the water). || Whisk the egg whites and lemon juice in a large, clean bowl until they form soft peaks. The lemon juice will stabilise the egg whites, make them easier to work with and help to prevent over-whisking. || Add the sugar and continue to whisk until firm peaks form when the whisk is removed. Do not whisk beyond this stage – the egg whites will start to collapse and separate into dry froth and runny liquid, and you'll lose all the air that you've whisked in. || When the chocolate has melted, remove the bowl from the heat. Whisk one-third of the egg whites into the hot chocolate quickly and vigorously, until thick and well combined. If you add the egg whites in too slowly, their cold temperature can make the hot chocolate seize, solidify and result in a lumpy mousse. || Fold the remaining egg whites into the chocolate mixture, using a spatula, until all of the egg white has been completely incorporated into the chocolate. Don't overmix at this stage as you'll knock out the air bubbles and the mousse will be dense. || Spoon the mousse mixture into four Martini glasses. Chill in the fridge for 2–3 hours, or until set.",easy pudding | classic french desserts | dairy-free christmas desserts | dark chocolate treats | decadent dessert | easy dinner party | our best chocolate | recipes for chocolate lovers | summer dessert | the best chocolate dessert | valentine’s day dessert ideas | christmas | dinner party | father's day | mother's day | new year and hogmanay | valentine's day | chocolate mousse | dark chocolate | gluten free | nut free | vegetarian | Raymond Blanc's Kitchen Secrets | Desserts | French | http://schema.org/GlutenFreeDiet | http://schema.org/VegetarianDiet,4.653846153846154,52

(If you don’t have a food processor, put the biscuits into a strong plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin instead.) Sprinkle the amaretti biscuits on the bottom and the sides of the cake tin, tilting and shaking to get an even coating. Reserve some of the crumbs to sprinkle on the top of the finished cheesecake. || Drain the ricotta cheese and put into a mixing bowl with the sugar. Using electric beaters, whisk until well combined. Gradually add the eggs, one at a time, whisking well between each addition. || Stir in the cream, lemon zest and the amaretto liqueur. The mixture should be very soft and light. || Pour the cheese mixture slowly into the prepared tin, starting in the middle to avoid disturbing the crumbs. Put on a baking tray and bake in the centre of the oven for 10 minutes. || Reduce the oven temperature to 160C/140C Fan/Gas 3 and cook for 1 hour, or until the cheesecake is just set. Do not allow to over-brown. If the cheesecake does start to brown while it is still very wobbly, cover the tin loosely with a large piece of foil. || When the cheesecake is ready, turn the oven off and open the door slightly. Wedge a folded tea towel or wooden spoon in the door to keep it ajar and leave the cheesecake to cool completely. This will take 3–4 hours and should prevent the top from cracking. When the cake is completely cool, transfer to the fridge and chill for at least 2 hours before removing from the tin. || Slide a knife around the cheesecake, taking care to retain as much of the crumb as possible, and release gently from the tin. Slide carefully off the tin base onto a serving plate and sprinkle the top with the reserved amaretti crumbs.

When the pasta is as thin as you can go, cut into strips about 3mm wide for tagliatelle or thinner for linguine. || Hang over a rolling pin or similar so that the pasta can dry slightly while you make the sauce. || To make the pasta by machine: tip the flour into a food processor, then add the eggs, olive oil and salt and pulse until the mixture forms small crumbs. Tip out on to a work surface and squash into a ball, then knead, pulling the dough together for a couple of minutes, until smooth. || Flour the rollers of the pasta machine. Cut the pasta in half and using a rolling pin, roll to about 5mm thick rectangle. Starting at the thickest setting, feed the dough through the machine, turning the handle with one hand and holding the dough as it comes through the machine with the other. Change the setting on the pasta machine to the next-thickest setting, flour it again if needed and feed the pasta sheet through the machine the same way. Keep going, making the opening smaller each time – you might need to cut the pasta in half lengthways as it gets towards the end. Fold the pasta in half lengthways then cut into strips as above. || For the sauce, add the broccoli to boiling water for 4-5 minutes until just tender. || Meanwhile, bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil. Add the pasta and cook for 3-4 minutes until it rises to the surface. Drain into a colander, reserving some of the cooking water. || Add the broccoli to the pasta and add the anchovies and mix well to combine. Add 2 tablespoons of the cooking water and cook for 1 minute stirring as you go. The pasta should be coated in the broccoli and anchovy. || Pile the pasta into serving bowls, then top with the Parmesan.",20 minute meals | anchovy pasta | best broccoli | eat well for less | filling pasta | good mood food | low-calorie | lower-calorie pasta | veg-packed comfort food | whole grain meals | summer dinner | pasta | broccoli | anchovies | healthy | nut free | pregnancy friendly | Eat Well for Less? | Main course | Italian | http://schema.org/LowCalorieDiet,4,8

Line a large baking sheet with baking paper. || Sieve the salt, mustard powder, baking powder and flour into a bowl.  This helps to add air into the mixture and make the scones light and fluffy. || Add the butter to the flour mixture. Using your fingertips, lightly rub in the butter until you get a fine breadcrumb consistency.  Using your fingertips will stop the butter from melting. || Add 100g/3½oz of the grated cheese into the flour mixture, and rub it in lightly. Save the remaining cheese for later. Add the chives and mix in. || Make a well in the centre of the mixture and add the cold milk a little at a time, mixing between each addition until the dough starts to come together. You may not need all the milk, don’t add too much, it should be a crumbly dough-like consistency. || Tip the mixture onto a lightly floured surface and bring it together into a ball using your hands. Shape it into a 2cm/1in thick disc using your hands (alternatively use a rolling pin). Don’t roll the dough too thinly or you will end up with crunchy biscuits instead of fluffy scones. || Using a medium-sized cutter (about 4–5cm/1½– 2in diameter) cut the dough into circles, using one sharp tap and not twisting the dough as you cut. Twisting the scone mix can result in an uneven rise. || Place the scones on the lined baking sheet and repeat until you have used all the dough. || Brush a little milk on the top of the scones using a pastry brush. Sprinkle with the leftover cheese. || Bake the scones for about 12 minutes, or until they are golden-brown. Allow to cool slightly on a wire rack and serve slightly warm.

Put the onion into a jar or bowl and cover with the vinegar (or lime juice), pressing down on the onions. Cover and leave the onions to steep. || Pour the kefir, buttermilk or yoghurt into a small dish and stir in the ½ teaspoon of paprika, ½ teaspoon of salt, lemon juice, mustard, maple syrup and garlic. Add the chicken and turn to coat in the marinade. Cover the dish, then leave in the fridge for at least 4 hours or up to 2 days.

Lift the chicken out of the marinade, but don’t try and shake it off. Dredge both sides of the chicken in the seasoned flour, then dip briefly back into the marinade and dredge again. This double-dredging is essential to get a thick, shaggy coating. You can leave the coated chicken in the flour dish until you fry. || Mix the garlic mayonnaise with the chilli oil and honey, and spread over both sides of a split burger bun (or a couple of slices of bread). Put a plate lined with kitchen paper by (but not dangerously near) the hob, if you want to get rid of any excess fat once the chicken’s cooked. || Pour enough oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed saucepan to come about 3½cm/1⅓in up the sides. Heat until a small piece of bread becomes golden and crisp almost instantly; if you have a food thermometer, you want the fat to be at 190°C when the chicken goes in. (CAUTION: hot oil can be dangerous. Do not leave unattended.) Using tongs, gently lower the chicken into the hot oil, and cook for 3–4 minutes on each side, until the coating is deep gold and very crisp and the chicken is completely cooked through. Drain on the paper-lined plate and leave to stand (for a couple of minutes) while you shred some iceberg lettuce and get out your pickles. || Put a handful of lettuce on the mayo on the bottom of the bun, top with the fried chicken, add kimchi and pink-pickled onions, scatter with a bit more lettuce and squidge on the top of the bun.

Each pancake (without topping) provides 88kcal, 7.5g carbohydrates (of which 0.9g sugars), 5g fat (of which 2g saturates), 0.4g fibre and 0.2g salt.",Makes 12 small pancakes,40,"110g/4oz plain flour, sifted || pinch of salt || 2 eggs || 200ml/7fl oz milk mixed with 75ml/3fl oz water || 50g/2oz butter || caster sugar || lemon juice || lemon wedges","Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl with a sieve held high above the bowl so the flour gets an airing. || Now make a well in the centre of the flour and break the eggs into it. Then begin whisking the eggs – any sort of whisk or even a fork will do – incorporating any bits of flour from around the edge of the bowl as you do so. || Next gradually add small quantities of the milk and water mixture, still whisking (don't worry about any lumps as they will eventually disappear as you whisk). || When all the liquid has been added, use a rubber spatula to scrape any elusive bits of flour from around the edge into the centre, then whisk once more until the batter is smooth, with the consistency of thin cream. || Now melt the 50g/2oz of butter in a small saucepan or a bowl in the microwave. || Spoon two tablespoons of the butter into the batter and whisk it in, then pour the rest into a bowl and use it to lubricate the pan, using a wodge of kitchen paper to smear it round before you make each pancake. || Now get the pan really hot, then turn the heat down to medium and, to start with, do a test pancake to see if you're using the correct amount of batter. I find two tablespoons is about right for an 18cm/7in pan. It's also helpful if you spoon the batter into a ladle so it can be poured into the hot pan in one go. || As soon as the batter hits the hot pan, tip it around from side to side to get the base evenly coated with batter. It should take only half a minute or so to cook; you can lift the edge with a palette knife to see if it's tinged gold as it should be. || Flip the pancake over using a turner or palette knife – the other side will need a few seconds only – then simply slide it out of the pan onto a plate. || Stack the pancakes as you make them between sheets of greaseproof paper (or non-stick baking paper) on a plate sat over simmering water. This will keep them warm while you make the rest. || To serve, sprinkle each pancake with freshly squeezed lemon juice and caster sugar, fold in half, then in half again to form triangles, or else simply roll them up. Serve sprinkled with a little more sugar and lemon juice and extra sections of lemon.",quick | best pancake | our best family favourites | recipes every student should know | our best brunch | low-carb desserts | breakfast in bed | breakfast pancake | christmas breakfasts | christmas market | easter brunch | easy brunch | easy pancake | father's day brunch | kid-friendly brunch | kid's pancake | pancake party | perfect pancakes | quick breakfast | quick desserts | special breakfast | sweet pancake | valentine's day brunch ideas | weekend breakfast | what to do with lots of milk | father's day | mother's day | pancake day | student food | winter | pancakes | plain flour | egg | caster sugar | lemon juice | nut free | pregnancy friendly | vegetarian | Desserts | British | http://schema.org/VegetarianDiet,4.5256410256410255,234

Rub the dough with oil, place in a bowl, cover, then rest for 30 minutes. || Divide the dough into 4 balls. Take one of these balls and roll out on a lightly floured surface to the size of just smaller than the base of a large frying pan. Brush the roti very, very generously with ghee. || Take a knife and cut from the centre to the edge of the circle (a radius line). Take the cut edge and roll it around, following the line of the radius of the circle, so you end up with a cone and tuck in any loose pieces under and all the way in to keep the cone together. Stand the cone up, then flatten it and push the tip of the cone all the way down with your thumb. Repeat with the remaining 3 balls and leave to rest for at least 4 hours, loosely covered. || Heat a large, heavy-based frying pan on a high-medium heat and, using a heat-proof brush, brush the base with ghee. || Roll out one of the pieces of dough again on a flour-dusted surface to the size of just smaller than the base of the frying pan (make sure the edges are thin too). Carefully pop it onto the hot pan and brush the surface of the roti with more ghee. Then flip the roti over, brush the other side with ghee. || Cook for a few more minutes, flipping when you get a golden-brown colour on the underside, with little touches of brown. Take tongs, or two wooden spatulas and crush or beat the roti gently so it flakes up and the layers separate a little, taking in the edges to the centre. The roti should be flaky at the top, but soft inside.  Pop into a clean, dry tea towel to keep warm while you do the same with the remaining 3 pieces of dough. || To serve, portion up the curry into bowls, top with micro coriander and red amaranth and enjoy with the buss up shut (paratha roti).",ways to use up pumpkin | best vegetarian | autumnal vegetarian | easy veggie curry | jamaican flavours | nutty comfort food | veggie comfort food | autumn | bonfire night | halloween | vegetable curry | pumpkin | egg free | pregnancy friendly | vegetarian | Saturday Kitchen | Main course | Caribbean | http://schema.org/VegetarianDiet,4.346153846153846,26

Chicken in a pot with lemon and orzo,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/chicken_in_a_pot_with_47197,https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/collections/one-pot_pasta_recipes,"A family favourite, this is a simple one-pot dish which brings comfort and joy, and it is my pleasure to share that with you.",Serves 4–6,180,"1 whole chicken, approx. 1.5kg/3lb 5oz || 1 tbsp olive oil || 2 lemons, zest and juice || 3 fat garlic cloves, grated || 2 tsp dried tarragon (or dried thyme) || 2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into batons || 2 medium leeks, cut into 2cm/¾in rounds || 2 tsp sea salt flakes (or 1 tsp fine sea salt) || ½ tsp dried chilli flakes (optional) || 300g/10½oz orzo || 6 tbsp finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, plus extra to serve || freshly grated Parmesan, to serve (optional)","Untruss the chicken and remove all the string. If time allows, leave it on a board for 40 minutes or so to lose its chill. Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. || Heat the oil in a large flameproof casserole with a tightly fitting lid; I use an enamelled cast-iron oval casserole 29cm/11½in long, into which the chicken fits neatly, leaving just a small space all around it to fit the vegetables later. Place the chicken in the hot oil, breast-side down, and cook for 3–5 minutes over a high heat until the skin is richly golden. Then turn the chicken the right way up. || Take the pan off the heat and, aiming for the space around the chicken, grate in the lemon zest, add the garlic and dried tarragon (or thyme) and give a quick stir into the oil as best you can. Scatter the vegetables around the chicken, followed by the salt and chilli flakes (if using), and squeeze in the juice from the lemons. || Pour in 1.5 litres/2⅔ pints cold water – covering all but the very top of the breast – put back on a high heat and bring to the boil. Once it’s bubbling, clamp on the lid and carefully transfer to the oven to cook for 1¼ hours, though check to make sure the chicken is all but cooked through and the carrots soft. || Take the pot out of the oven and add the orzo all around the chicken, pushing it under the liquid and giving it a stir as far you can manage in the restricted space. Put the lid back on and return the casserole to the oven for another 15 minutes, by which time the orzo should be soft and swollen. || Remove from the oven and let the casserole stand, uncovered, for 15 minutes before serving. The orzo will continue to soak up the broth as it stands. || Stir in 4 tablespoons of the parsley, and then sprinkle over a little more. Place a dish by the casserole, and then pull the chicken gently apart with a couple of forks, removing any bones and skin that come loose to the dish. I find it easiest to do this while the chicken’s still in the pot but, if you prefer, you can try and remove it to a carving board, though it’s likely to fall to pieces a bit as you do so. Stir the chicken and orzo again and ladle into bowls, sprinkling with parsley as you go. You may also want to offer Parmesan to sprinkle over: I prefer it without, but there is a strong pro-Parmesan contingent in my house.",our best one-pot meals | best orzo | big dinner party dishes | chicken pasta | comforting chicken | comfort food with a twist | easy dinner party | super-easy meals to cook for your friends | family chicken dinners | one-pot pasta | one-pot wonders | one pot chicken | rainy day food | recipes for cosy season | spring chicken recipes | weekend dinner ideas | dinner party | easy family dinners | spring recipes | winter | one-pot dishes | chicken | orzo | egg free | nut free | pregnancy friendly | Nigella’s Cook | Eat | Repeat | Main course,3.981651376146789,109

You may need push the mixture down from the sides a couple of times to make sure the mixture is well blended. || Divide the batter between the prepared cake tins and spread it out evenly with a rubber spatula. || Bake for 22–25 minutes or until the cakes are nicely risen and just beginning to shrink away from the sides of the tins. Remove them from the oven and cool for 5 minutes before turning out on to a wire rack. Take off the lining paper and leave the cakes to cool. || When the cakes are cold, cut them in half, horizontally, with a long-bladed serrated knife. Take care to keep the knife parallel to the work surface, to get a good even cut. Place the cakes back on the wire rack or a board, cut sides up. || For the filling, put the jam in a saucepan with the sour cherries and Kirsch and place over a low heat. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 6–8 minutes, stirring, until the jam has melted and the cherries are beginning to swell. Leave to cool for 15 minutes. || Sprinkle the cherry brandy over the chocolate sponges, then spread three of them with the sour cherry mixture and leave to cool.

There is no need to spread it out, but try to keep the spoonfuls evenly spaced over the cake. Sprinkle with a little of the grated chocolate. || Top with another sponge and repeat the layers twice more. You should end up with three layers of sponge, cherries, cream and chocolate. Place the final sponge on top, with its top surface facing upwards. || Whip the remaining 200ml/8fl oz of the cream with an electric hand-whisk until soft peaks form. || Using the flat side of a palette knife, spread about three tablespoons of the cream over the top of the cake, taking it all the way to the edge. Spoon the remaining cream into a piping bag fitted with a large, plain nozzle and pipe rosettes around the edge of the cake. Tip almost all the remaining grated chocolate into the centre and sprinkle the rest over the rosettes. || Decorate with fresh cherries if you have some.

Place over a medium heat until steaming. || Whisk the egg yolks together in a bowl along with the second half of the sugar. Pour the steaming milk mixture over the whisked yolks and whisk well. || Pour this back into the pan and continuously stir over a medium heat until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat and pour through a sieve into a heatproof bowl. || Allow to cool before placing in the fridge for 24 hours. || Churn in an ice cream machine until it’s ready, then stir through the rum-soaked raisins and freeze. || To make the pastry, you’ll need a large bowl, or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or a food processor. Add the flour, almonds, sugar and salt and mix well. Add in the cold cubed butter and rub in with your fingertips or mix/pulse until it resembles loose breadcrumbs. Add in the cream cheese and mix briefly until a dough forms – it won't take very long. Don't be tempted to overwork the dough at this stage. || Tip the dough out onto your work surface and gently use your hands to bring it together, then wrap tightly in some baking paper or cling film and press into a disc shape – this helps it to cool down evenly and more quickly. Chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours until firm, or overnight. || Grease the sandwich tin liberally with softened butter and line the base with a circle of baking paper, then put this in the fridge while you roll out the dough. || Lightly flour the work surface, then gently knead the dough to make sure it's all evenly the same temperature. Roll out the dough to a rough circle about 4–5mm/¼in thick – this will be folded over the apples so it needs to be a rough circle, almost galette-like in its assembly. || Transfer and press the dough into the prepared tin, making sure the dough is draping nicely over the edges of the tin. || Prepare the apples by coring, then thinly slicing them. It's best to do this quickly and to not submerge them in water even if they start to brown slightly. Toss them in a bowl with the sugar and rum. || Layer the apple slices into the pastry case – you don't need to be really precise or precious about it, but do bear in mind that the finished tart will slice really nicely if it's layered up consistently. Fold the edges of the pastry over the apples, then chill in the fridge. || Preheat the oven to 190C/170C Fan/Gas 5. Place a sturdy baking tray on a shelf in the middle of the oven to preheat. || Brush the pastry with the egg wash and sprinkle the demerara sugar on top. Place the tart on the preheated baking tray and bake for 40 minutes or until the pastry is deep golden. || Remove from the oven and allow the tart to cool slightly before removing it from the tin. If it cools too much, there's a risk that it will weld itself to the tin; if this happens, briefly warm it up again in the oven. || To glaze the tart, gently warm up the jelly or jam with a splash of water in a small pan over a low heat or use a microwave. Brush this over the apples. Dust the tart with icing sugar, if you like. Serve warm with the rum and raisin ice cream.

Rub salt and pepper into the chicken and set aside. || In a blender, add half the yoghurt and all the remaining tikka ingredients. Blend to a smooth paste. Transfer to a large bowl and whisk in the remaining yoghurt. Taste to check for spiciness and add more chilli if preferred. || Mix the chicken in the yoghurt mixture. Cover with cling film and, if possible, leave the chicken to marinate in the fridge overnight, or at least 4–5 hours. || For the naan, combine the yoghurt, milk, salt and sugar with 200ml/7fl oz water in a jug. || Sift the flour and baking powder into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. Pour in the liquid and 2 tablespoons of rapeseed oil. Mix to form a soft dough. || Knead for 5–6 minutes, or until the dough stops looking ragged and becomes smooth. Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel and set aside to prove for 30–40 minutes. Remove the dough and knead for another minute or two, then return to the bowl. Cover and leave in a warm place for 1–2 hours. || For the salad, combine all the ingredients in a bowl. Refrigerate until ready to serve. || To cook the chicken, either preheat a grill to medium-high or prepare a barbecue. (If there is no other option you can use an oven set to its highest temperature.) Thread the chicken pieces onto metal skewers. || Grill the chicken for 8–10 minutes, basting occasionally with the yoghurt marinade. To check the chicken is cooked through, take one of the largest pieces and cut in half. If there is no sign of pink and the juices run clear the chicken is cooked. || To cook the naans, lightly oil a work surface and divide the dough into 4–6 balls. Using your fingers or an oiled rolling pin, flatten each ball into a round shape about 1cm/½in thick. Keep the remaining balls of dough under the damp tea towel as you work. || Heat a large, dry frying pan with a tightly-fitting lid over a medium heat. Transfer one circle of dough to the pan and cover securely with the lid. Cook the naan for 3–4 minutes. When it is golden-brown, mottled and puffed up, flip it over and cook the other side for 3–4 minutes. Repeat with the remaining dough. || Meanwhile, melt the butter and mix with the remaining rapeseed oil. As soon as the naans are cooked, spread them generously with the melted butter mixture and scatter with sea salt, nigella seeds and poppy seeds. Set aside for a few minutes. || Alternatively, preheat your oven to 250C/230C Fan/Gas 9. Place an uncooked naan on a large baking tray and bake on the top shelf one at a time. Turn when you see the bread rise and puffed. Once browned on both sides, apply the butter mixture as above. || To serve, scatter the naans with chopped coriander and serve with the chicken tikka and salad.",classic curry | barbecue skewer | best curry | fakeaway | family chicken dinners | flatbread meals | indian breads | indian family feasts | lean meats | mild chicken curry | quick barbecue | recipes for eid al-adha | spicy chicken | takeaway favourites | weekend dinner ideas | eid al-fitr | chicken curry | chicken breast | nut free | pregnancy friendly | Saturday Kitchen | Main course | Indian,4.159090909090909,44

But do give the icing a stir with a spatula every now and again. || Line the bottom of your springform cake tin (you will need a good, leakproof one as this is a very wet batter) with baking parchment. || Put the flour, bicarbonate of soda, salt, instant espresso and cocoa powder in a bowl and fork to mix. || Mix together the sugar, water, coconut oil and vinegar until the coconut oil has melted, and stir into the dry ingredients. Pour into the prepared tin and bake for 35 minutes. Though do check at the 30-minute mark to see if it is already done. When it’s ready, the cake will be coming away from the edges of the tin and a cake tester will come out clean, apart from a few crumbs. This is a fudgy cake and you don’t want to overdo it. || Once the cake is cooked, transfer the tin to a wire rack and let the cake cool in its tin. Once completely cool remove from the tin. || Turn to your icing, and give it a good stir with a spatula to check it is at the right consistency. It needs to be runny enough to cover the cake, but thick enough to stay (mostly) on the top. So pour over the cake, and use a spatula to ease the icing to the edges, if needed. If you wish to decorate, now is the time to do it. In which case, sprinkle joyously with rose petals and chopped pistachios or anything else that your heart desires; otherwise, leave it gleaming darkly and, indeed, sumptuously. Leave to stand for 30 minutes for the icing to set before slicing into the cake.",best cake | vegan baking | best chocolate cake | chocolate baking | chocolate birthday cake | dairy-free chocolate | dairy-free cake | dairy-free christmas desserts | dairy-free kids party | dairy-free recipes for kids | dark chocolate treats | eggless cakes and baking | excellent easter chocolate | how to make cakes | our best chocolate | perfect pistachio | recipes for chocolate lovers | the best chocolate dessert | valentine's day baking | vegan birthday cake | vegan cake | vegan dessert | vegan easter baking | vegan valentine's day | afternoon tea | birthday party | dinner party | mother's day | chocolate cake | dark chocolate | coconut oil | dairy free | egg free | pregnancy friendly | vegan | vegetarian | Simply Nigella | Cakes and baking | http://schema.org/LowLactoseDiet | http://schema.org/VeganDiet | http://schema.org/VegetarianDiet,4.74,50

Leave to cool and turn the oven off for now. Squeeze the soft roasted garlic from the cloves and set aside. || Tip both of the flours into the bowl of a freestanding mixer fitted with a dough hook (alternatively use any large bowl and knead by hand). Add the yeast and salt and mix well to combine. || Warm the milk to hand hot, either in a heatproof jug in the microwave or in a small saucepan over a low heat (take care not to burn yourself when testing the temperature). Add the malt extract and roast garlic purée and mix to combine. Pour into the mixer bowl along with the butter. || Mix until combined and then continue to knead the dough for about 7 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. Shape the dough into a ball, return to the bowl, cover loosely with either cling film or a clean, slightly damp tea towel and leave to prove until doubled in size (about 45 minutes–1 hour). || Lightly dust the work surface with flour, turn the dough out and knead lightly for 20 seconds. Weigh the dough and divide into 18 even portions. Divide the grated cheese between the dough portions and incorporate the cheese into the dough while shaping into a ball. || To finish shaping, pull pieces of the dough from the outside of each ball and push into the centre, working around until you have a neat ball where the dough is smooth and stretched underneath with a seam on top. Repeat with the remaining dough. || With the seams on the underside, arrange the balls on a large baking sheet lined with baking paper with one ball in the middle, six around this middle ball and a further 11 evenly spaced around the outside edge but leaving a little space between each one to allow for rising. || Cover loosely with either a clean tea towel or lightly oiled cling film and leave to rise at room temperature for a further 45 minutes or until doubled in size. || Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Brush the dough balls with milk to glaze and scatter each with either dried oregano, poppy or sesame seeds. Bake on the middle shelf of the oven for 15 minutes or until risen and golden brown. || Meanwhile, to serve, melt the butter and add the parsley. Season with salt and pepper. As soon as the rolls come out of the oven, brush with the melted butter and leave to cool slightly.
